## This repository contains the code of Customer Churn Prediction model in R studio.

### Requirements:
#### 1) R Studio

###### Overview: Here I have predicted a model that can predict the chances of a customer leaving the company's paid subscription services.
###### I have also formulated a list of top 3 features that influences a customer to churn
###### A logistic Regression model has been created that predicts the target class of whether the customer will churn or not.

###### View the Customer_Churn_Prediction_R.R file for the code

###### View UV6696-XLS-ENG.csv for the Dataset

#### NOTE: Try to run all the libraries before building the model and finding results. Also, this was a case study purchased from Harvard's Website.
